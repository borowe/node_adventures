This is a working example of Facebook's React Tutorial.

If you freshly git cloned this app don't forget to run...

"npm update" to update/install all the package dependencies found in the package.json

I think you could also run "npm install" alternatively.


Then run "npm run build", which will build the app

Then run "npm run start", which will start serving the app
